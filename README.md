# DevOps with Docker
This repository contains my personal completed exercises of University of Helsinki's course [DevOps with Docker](https://docker-hy.github.io/).

## Completed exercises
Exercises are either as text files (unformatted text files without a file suffix and markdown files with an `.md` suffix) or in folders. Dockerfiles have prefixes which correspond with the project names referenced in the assignments.
